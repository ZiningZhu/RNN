      "--------------------------\n",
      "2: At the last minute, we booked Sunworld Dynasty hotel through the Agoda website. We stayed for five nights and the service we received is on par with standards of a five star foreign-own hotels (e.g. Sheraton). Most staff could communicate in English, which was helpful. (Not a lot of locals in the city can speak/understand English so it was nice to be able to speak our first language at the end of the day). Complimentary bottles of water were provided every day. We had a fair size room with a king bed. Bathroom was also a nice size with a shower and a bathtub. Turn down service was a nice touch. Note that there is only one non-smoking floor. Gym and pool facilities were also very good.\n",

      "--------------------------\n",
      "5: It is now known as the Sunworld Dynasty Hotel. rated itself as 5 stars, more like 2 stars in fact.The toilet broke down in our first room and when we moved to another room, the toilet broke down again twice. By that stage, we were tired of moving so stayed put. Finally figured out that one is not supposed to dump toilet paper in the bowl. After wiping, throw it in the wastepaper basket beside the toilet bowl. I know it sounds gross but it worked.I think they have a major sewage problem in the hotel cos we saw the workmen working on the toilet in another room.Also, the ac does not work. It is always warm at 23 degrees.Go back there again,NO WAY!\n",

      "--------------------------\n",
      "8: 10 years ago I stayed in this hotel for my first business trip to Beijing. It still has this impressive central hall. Apart from that, since then there has been no renovation and the management quality has detriorated. The breakfast budget still has some nice spots but also quite some room for improvement (running out of some items very early, dangerous looking sushi). Room service, even on the weekends, comes only around 3pm. Bathrooms seem to be partially redone. But still have floor standing toilets, not wall hung toilets like modern hotels have, therefore still unclean and dirty looking. Overall hotel is ok but could do better.\n",

      "11: Tianlun Dynasty was a great hotel with good location within walking distance to Hutongs, Tianmen Square or Wangfujing shopping street. Room was really clean, nice and spacy. Hotel had good facilities, such as massage, swimming pool and bar. Also, the breakfest buffet was excellent!\n",

      "14: Nice hotel with clean room, comfy king bed, our rate did not include breakfast. We ate Chinese breakfast at the restaurants down the street from hotel. Hotel has a lovely atrium with buffet-style restaurant. We found the concierge and travel desk to be extremely helpful (we bought plane tickets and acrobat tickets through travel desk). Not everyone on the staff spoke English, but there was usually someone at the desk that did. Would recommend. FYI, at the time we visited, May 2007, there was major work being done on Wangfujing Ave in preparation for the 2008 Olympics. If construction is still going on, do not accept a room that overlooks Wangfujing Ave or the Church because you will hear jackhammers.\n",

      "16: Great Value for your money\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "17: My husband and i had the pleasure of staying at Tianlun Dynasty Hotel in June as a stop over during our around the world tour this summer. Last year I went to Beijing and stayed at the Crown Plaza. While the room and service was decent, I elected to go with a hotel that was a bit more inexpensive but still in same area. Having read positive reviews for Tianlun Dynasty and saw it was in same area, I decided to go with it and was not disappointed. More than a few reviewers of this hotel mention the rooms facing the atrium and their annoyance at the music from piano in atrium lobby. Its worth noting that the Tianlun and Crown Plaza both had pianos in their atrium lobbies, which came alive during dinner. They had either a singer entertaining the dinner crowd or just music playing but at both hotels, music was over at a decent time to be able to sleep comfortably overnight. I understand the lure of western style Crown Plaza , however I dont think that the asian influenced style and service of Tianlun Dynasty should be a deterrent. If they refer to themselves as a 4 star hotel its because the rooms are clean, nicely sized, sufficient toiletries, prompt housekeeping services, fitness center and in room internet access. Yes the style is dated but i think thats part of the charm. as far as it being a smoking hotel--China is a smoking country. heck, the pollution in China overall is no secret and known worldwide--you can literally see the haze. as far as finding people who speak english in China in general is a task in itself. but still, when you travel, you manage to exchange information somehow and it helps to learn a few words in their language instead of us always expecting others around the world to speak our language. If you want boutique, chic trendy hotel, then dont stay here. Stay here if you want a hotel in a great location, within walking distance of Forbidden City, night market, shopping center and great value for your money. Furthermore, they have a killer lunch buffet. Here's where Tianlun beats Crown Plaza. The buffet has everything from grilled meats, all sorts of veggies, any fresh fruit and juices, even haggen daz ice cream. you can even have Peking duck everyday and its great--by the way the Quanjude Duck restaurant was way over-rated. Im from NY and Peking duck here is way better on any corner in chinatown. but i digress, i highly recommend this lovely hotel. also..if anyone is interested in using a private , patience and very personable driver who speaks decent english, feel free to contact me. we used him last year and again this time around. both times, he was always very professional and kind. great experience in china overall.\n",

      "19: Would opt to stay in familiar Western chain hotel next time\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "20: Stayed with large group at this hotel. Pros: *The location is terrific...near the night market and busy shopping district. Can walk everywhere. Felt safe in small groups or alone. *The huge internal atrium area where there is music, dining, bar area. Great place to sit, have a pot of green tea or a cocktail, connect to the internet and plan the next days event. *The desk agent on the executive lounge floor was very helpful (language a bit of a barrier) in translation English to Mandarin for taxi cards. Cons:*It is a smoking hotel and I had a hard time breathing and had a sore throat for several days. I had to open the windows to air out the room but my room was on the outside overlooking the church next door so noise and air pollution was a constant.*Poor English/communication from staff...from the front desk to the restaurants, it was impossible to communicate if you do not know minimal Mandarin. They were not able to give anyone a non-smoking room and did not appear eager to help resolve the complaints from non-smokers. *Rooms were dated and could have used a good cleaning. *There seemed to be some questionable activities going on with the karaoke bars and lounges which we learned were not run/managed by the hotel but rather third party. It gave the hotel a bit of a questionable atmosphere.\n",

      "22: Four stars is a joke\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "23: This is definitely not a four-star facility by any definition. Rooms were small and fixtures and furniture dated. Lobby layout and materials were old and sagging. Staff in general were fine though service and attitude were distinctly inferior to Hong Kong. Location is good. This problem of overrating hotels is endemic in the PRC. The only hotels that reasonably correspond to their ratings are those that are of western origin. I most likely will not stay here again.\n",

      "25: Excellent hotel but don't organise trips through hotel\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "26: Stayed in Tianlun Dynasty for a week. First few days stayed in a standard room and then stayed in deluxe for last two days. Both room types were excellent. Although got better view in deluxe, there wasn't much in it. Bathroom was slightly nicer and decor of room was bit more polished. Hotel staff were very pleasant but didn't their English was not as good as I was expecting.If you do stay, don't forget to bring a laptop since you get free internet access in room. We didn't so used business centre downstairs for 20yuan for 10 minutes after the first 10 free minutes. We then found a &quot;cyber bar&quot; on side street south west from hotel where it was 3yuan / hour.Went to Chinese opera (a trip organised through hotel) which was okay but a bit overpriced for an hour performance. Also considered the Great Wall trip through hotel for about 300 yuan pp but found a far cheaper price (150 yuan pp) at a travel agent on the side street south of the church next to the Tianlun.If you need to call home, you need to buy an IP card (rather than an IC card) and you can then make cheaper phone calls back home from the hotel room.Also stayed in Park Plaza hotel in Beijing - comparing the two, I would recommend the Tianlun. Although the Park Plaza is more chique and modern, the Tianlun rooms are still excellent and the hotel has more character. Furthermore, the Tianlun location on the Wanfujing High Street was extremely useful and very close to Forbidden City and other tourist things.\n",

      "28: Beijing by foot\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "29: We chose this hotel because the price was reasonable and the location was near the Imperial Palace. The hotel was much nicer than we had expected for the price. It had a lovely, huge inner atrium which was especially nice in the winter. The room was satisfactory. But what we liked most was being able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. We only had to take the subway once, to a distant duck restaurant. To stay within our budget, we didn't eat at the hotel. Instead we found noodle shops (with pictures) within a block of the hotel.\n",

      "31: Tianlun Dynasty is a great hotel\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "32: I want to recommend the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel. It turned out to be a great choice. Location is fabulous, next to the main commercial shopping area and walking distance to Tianamen Square and the Forbidden City. It is not on the American hotel circuit, so it has an international clientele, which we prefer. Has a beautiful central atrium--complete with palm trees and fountains and soft music in the evening--which provides a lovely haven from the rigors of Beijing street life. Yes, perhaps its a bit tacky, but still a nice environment. Warning: make sure you get an outside room, with street exposure, rather than on this atrium. Other reviews have warned that you can hear the music at night, and I think it is probably true. If you can splurge, reserve a higher floor, with open views. We had a lovely view of the Forbidden City on the 10th floor. This is the Executive Floor, a bit more expensive, but you get free breakfast, so I believe it evens out. (We got a good deal on hotels.com) The staff is lovely, although not many speak much English, which is true of Beijing in general and part of the experience. But the concierge was able to write where we wanted to go in Chinese so that we could show it to the cab driver, and the travel desk was very helpful. We booked a car and guide from the hotel for days when we wanted to have an easier time getting around.\n",

Most of the staff had knowledge of English and a few were very fluent.- My room was spacious and very clean. I upgraded my room to the executive floor and the &quot;extras&quot; were worth it. There's a lounge with coffee and finger foods available at certain times and there's always an employee on standby to help with your room if needed.- Hotel location was excellent and couldn't have been any better.- I ate at the hotel restaurants a couple of times...it was a little pricey, but the quality of the food was well worth the money.Food tips: - Try the peking duck in the restaurant in the basement. Pricing is moderate and it tastes great!- If you get room service, try the club sandwich!I will stay at this hotel the next time I'm back in Beijing.\n",

The courtyard is lovely for having a relaxing evening drink but be warned its not cheap. The same is said for the mini bar it was madly over priced but you get that in every hotel. There is a shop just across the road where you can get drinks for your room at a 10th of the price. I would defiantly stay here again.\n",

I think a few of the workers went to school in canada, austrailia, and the USA. The facilities were very clean and service was excellent. The highlight of the stay is the big open concept courtyard in the middle of the hotel. I spent a fair amount of time just relaxing and enjoying the environment.I stayed on the dynasty floor (10th floor) which offers guests alot of vip services such as conference center, coffee and drinks and snacks, its own receptionist, english magazines and newspapers, and discounts at the restaurants.There are alot of restaurants to choose from at the hotel. I think there was at least 3 chinese cuisine restaurants alone. shanghai style, hunan style with peking duck and an upscale cantonese restaurant with shark fin soup and abalone. The restaurants are not cheap but the food is delicious.I would come back here on vacation in beijing. There are many historic sites and shopping districts very close to the hotel. pricing listed on their website is pretty high but u can book the hotel for a fair price on most online hotel booking websites.i wish i brought my camera to take pictures of the hotel. There was a few special events happening and the decorations were unbelievable.\n",

The hotel room (9th floor) was large, clean, and comfortable. The hotel service was great. People at the desk and guest services spoke English and were most accommodating. Anyone who couldn't understand what we wanted quickly ran to get someone who did. We didn't take advantage of their many services but did go to 2 of their restaurants and 3 tours they offered. The hotel is beautiful and right on Wangfujing Street. (The main street in Beijing) Taxis were not expensive in Beijing but the drivers knew no English. The ones we used were very nice and the hotel doorman told them where we wanted to go. (Always carry your hotel name and address written in Chinese to show the driver) on your way home.We would stay there again if ever in Beijing and would recommend it to everyone.

      "56: The Tianlun Dynasty Hotel is located centrally in the center of Beijing on Wangfujing Street. Our tour guide claimed it to be a 5-star hotel, which perhaps for China, it is; however, it is definitely not a 5-star hotel. It IS a good hotel - comparable to a Sheraton and the likes and has most of the standard hotel amenities. The staff is cordial and the biggest plus is that hotel guests get 10 minutes of internet access at the business center free (after that, it's 2 yuan per minute or about 25 cents per minute). The buffet breakfast at the hotel is ok - has your standard western breakfast (eggs made to order, cereals, various breads &amp; danishes, bacon, sausage ...) as well as some Chinese food (rice porridge, dim sum, etc). But overall, the breakfast isn't as good as some other breakfasts at hotels in China. Overall, a good hotel for tourists looking for a central location and decent rooms (clean, decently appointed, enough Chinese &amp; international TV stations, private bath, mini-bar, etc.).\n",

      "59: My Husband and I were in Beijing for a conference and spent 8 nights at the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel. We opted to stay in the city and taxi to the conference center north of the city. This hotel is in an excellent location. It is a 2 km walk to Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City and a 5 min taxi ride to the Silk Market, Temple of Heaven and other popular attractions. The hotel sits on Wangfujing Dajie a main shopping street with several malls and stores. Plus, there is a grocery store across the street in the basement of one of the malls where you can purchase large bottles of water and snacks. The hotel concierge will write out cards for you in Chinese to give to your taxi to drive you anywhere in the city. Buy a city map ahead of time and be prepared for the taxi to shuttle you all around the city to take you to your destination 2 blocks away. We took full advantage of the food options available at Tianlun. The buffets are pricey, but it was a great way for my husband to try some more adventurous cuisine. Our main complaint with the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel is similar to others; the walls are thin and it can seem a bit noisy at times. Since the a/c was on almost the entire time, it offered white noise, which masked some of the noise in the hallway and on the street. The staff are very helpful and speak English well. Don't expect this to be a 5 star hotel. If you want newer and fancier, book a room across the street at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, which is on the higher end of accomodations. That said, we found the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel very comfortable and a great price for its location and services.\n",

Room was really comfortable and all the staff were very friendly. Music from the courtyard was noticeable at first but we soon blanked it out. Good breakfast buffet too. Nice calm hotel in very busy city !\n",

      "--------------------------\n",
      "65: I enjoyed a 3 day stay here recently. As other folks mention they have a courtyard with classical music. The local is pretty good as well.Yes, the music does get annoying after a few days but the rooms are good quality and most importantly I was able to get the room for $125/night.If you're going for 2-3 days a good choice at $125.\n",

      "67: Really nice hotel!Ask for renovated rooms\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "68: We were a group of four people and we reserved for a good price through expedia. I had chosen the hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor and also on their website. The rooms looked modern and nice and everyone seemed to like the hotel and it's location. We got there after a grueling 30 hour trip from Miami and we had reserved one king-size room for me and my husband and two double beds for our firiends. The check-in was too long,there was only a reservation for two king sizes and it took a while to clear that up. They said they had upgraded us to an executive room (we had booked a superior room) and I felt satisfied. Upon reaching our room,however, I found out that the upgrade was only for our friends and that we had gotten a room staright from the Mao era: dingy,worn out...just plain UGLY! As we were spending 9 nights there,I called reception and asked them to change our room. I had to speak to about three different people before I got the manager.5 minutes later, the bellboy was at our door and showed us to our new room: much much nicer.Smaller, but at least it was renovated.Regarding the noise , that's another problem: Yes, there is music every night in the central indoor courtyard,but it finishes at 10:30 pm.However, and due to the design of this courtyard (really high roof,very beautiful but also great at carrying sound) just the noise of people having dinner/drinks carries up to the rooms when the music is over. I'm not sure how much of that noise can actually be heard inside the rooms that face the inside,since our room was facing the outside and, truth be told, the dingy inside-facing room at least has double wiondow-panes,but when we went to get the elevators you could really feel the way sound carries. Perhaps I am over-sensitive to noise but the outside facing rooms were also a bit noisy due to the traffic outside.Nothing that couldn't be remedied with a good pair of earplugs,though. The other noise complaint comes from the corridors themselves. If what you want is to sleep in, forget it;when people use the corridors and speak, you can hear everything from inside your room...there are no double doors,which would have helped. Another thing I did not like was the massage service: I went down and had one and the woman did not leave the room as I was undressing but rather stood there looking at me.During the massage, her hands went uncomfortably near areas which they should not have gone near,all very awkward and not at all relaxing.The beds were alsop rock-hard in the rooms...I personally like softer beds.All this said, the location is great, walking distance from tianamen,forbidden city and shopping.the pool was nice, the breakfast buffet was also good and for the price we paid it was a good value for money.It was a comfortable hotel, safe and clean with western style bathrooms and rooms,nice people working there,oriental service.\n",

      "70: Loved the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel!\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "71: This hotel is absolutely wonderful: great English-speaking staff, excellent housekeeping services, clean rooms, and fantastic location. This hotel is gleaming with a 5-star rating, and it truly was a luxurious refuge from the hustle of sightseeing and shopping. Each room had a Western bathroom, A/C, and free internet access. There is an indoor swimming pool; but, don't forget to pack a swim cap (mandatory here). Room service is excellent and the staff is very accommodating. Because I had reserved a room at this hotel later in the trip, I left one heavy luggage with the concierge for two and a half weeks (at no cost; just keep your luggage tag receipt). This enabled us to travel around China without carrying a bag full of souvenirs, and for this, I am so grateful to the Tianlun Dynasty hotel for being considerate to their clients.A taxicab ride from the Beijing airport to the hotel takes about 45 minutes and should cost about 100 yuan. If it's anything more, let the bell boy or bell girl assist you in getting the correct rate, when you arrive.There are plenty of things to do in Beijing. To get to Tian'anmen Square, it is about a 15 to 25 minute walk. St. Joseph Catholic church is next door, and a popular shopping area (Wangfujing Street) is around the corner. Another worthy shopping area is the Silk Market, which is about a 15 to 20 minute cab ride from the hotel. At the Silk Market, be prepared to bargain down the price to 75% of what they're asking. For other activities, such as the Great Wall of China, the hotel has a travel agency that can arrange it for you. Another plus is that there is an ATM on the hotel premises that accepts most cards.I plan on staying here during my next trip to Beijing, and would recommend it to you!\n",

The courtyard (center of the hotel) is very nice in the evening when they serve a buffet and have live classical music. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint is the breakfast buffet. It is decent but not nearly as sumptutious as I found in some less expensive hotels. I would definitely stay there again.\n",

A very good hotel, excellent rooms, specially requested prior to booking, twin beded room and was given 1 large bed (5') and 1 large single (4') which was fine with us as we have 2 adults and 1 child. Their standard twin beded room is 2 no of single beds. Front desk is very helpful and efficient, Concige was strong and house keeping is very good. Plus point, in room dining is 24 hours ordered a very good Hainan chicken rice for supper. Location is very good, Macdonalds, Bakery is a short 3 minutes walk away in Tong An market complex. The hawker street is just 3 minutes walk away. Would recomend anyone to stay there. Only minus point is that there is no direct access to this hotel from Wang fu zing. you would have to walk to a side lane to enter through the main entrance.\n",

This hotel is downtown just off the main shopping area and is handy to The Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. We would highly recommend this hotel.\n",

The hotel has a spa &amp; a gym in its premises. The room rents are quite nominal for a capital city ( ~$160) - My friends who stayed at Holiday Inn Central paid half the price but said the facilities were better. Not too much of recreation like movies, games possible in the room so you are kind of bored watching only few channels on TV.

First time to China so I am not an expert comparing with other hotels -- but it definitely served my needs. Super friendly staff all over who really have a desire to help out. Internet connection is fairly expensive. I did not sign up, yet I managed to connect to others non-encrypted wireless connections (for free).Clean and tidy. Room is OK, maybe a little bit dull but that goes for many hotels. Very comfy bed. Bathroom could have been bigger. What definitely could have been bigger too is the safe box, which is too small to fit a laptop.Liked the fact that the hotel is in walking distance from the silk and pearl market. Tried the gym, which was OK. Same goes with the breakfast buffet.Would also like to share with you a really good Chinese restaurant (serving delicious roasted duck and plenty of other dishes) at close walking distance from the hotel: Xiao Wang's Home Restaurant.\n",

      "--------------------------\n",
      "26: Well, Beijing is a city where you can still see preserver traditional Chinese buildings and high rise building in a City. It consists of five rings where first ring started from the Forbidden City. Chinese government preserve the building in first two rings and 3rd and 4th ring have the most development. Traders hotel located between 3rd and 4th ring and the is connected with the China World Trade building. The worst part is directly in front of the hotel, there is contruction on going. If you are looking for a place to stay for vacation, it is not really recommended but it is good for those that go for business trip as most of the offices like Motorola and Hewlett Packard are very near to Traders. Silk Road and Yashio where you can purchase all sort of cheap stuff from accessories, clothing, watches, tea pot, silk and et cetera is also very near to the hotel. These two places are really famous where there are no fixed price to an item and it has to depend on individual bargaining power. I suggest slash 80% from the price they tell you. Always remember to walk away if the price is not within your budget. There are a lot of stalls that selling the same item so, don't worry, you will surely get it. Manicure and Pedicure is highly recommended and please DON'T miss it! It's cheap and the quality is really good. You can get this from Yashio complex and the price is fairly the same of all the stalls. Get the O.P.I! For guy, please go for the head, arms and foot massage. It is cheap too! Beijing crispy duck is something you can't miss. I had it at Wang Xiao Hu. It is very near to the hotel as well. It is within walking distance. Please ask the bellboy where is the location. If you go to stall or restaurant that doesn't has a menu, please ask for the price before you order including drinks.I personally don't recommend you to shop for branded stuff in China as they have higher import tax. All and all, Beijing is a nice place to stay if you are interested in Forbidden City and Great Wall of China. The food are really nice too but the air polution is really bad! One more thing, most of them, they don't speak English even the taxi driver. Please prepare the hotel name in Chinese name. After you book the hotel, call the hotel to ask the name of their hotel in Chinese. Hope you have a wonderful trip in China.\n",

      "--------------------------\n",
      "29: Traders Hotel in Beijing is a midlevel business hotel, that does everything right within its class. It's a sister hotel to the much more luxurious (and more expensive) China World Hotel and is likewise situated within the modern China World complex, which includes a very high end mall, office towers and convention center. The lobby is small and somewhat dated, but the staff is very helpful, from the desk clerks to the elevator attendants. The rooms were small but relatively well kept. The bathroom was also small, with a combination shower/bath. The safe was too small for a laptop, which is a significant shortcoming in a business hotel. They provide complementary fresh fruit and bottled water each day. The internet access was easy to configure, though expensive (140 RMB/day) given the overall price level in Beijing. The breakfast buffet was modest but offers sufficient western and Chinese choices. The location is well suited for tourists, as the hotel sits atop a subway stop (Guamao) on line 1, from which one can easily get to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and other tourist sites. It's also just a few stops to transfer points for lines 2 and 5. Given the state of traffic in Beijing, easy access to the subway is an important plus. It's a short walk along Jiangwuomenwai to the Silk Street market, which offers several floors of souvenirs, t-shirts, knock offs, &quot;silk&quot; pajamas, etc. The shopkeepers are aggressive and haggling is required, but that's half the fun.\n",

      "32: By far the best aspect of this hotel was the fabulously comfortable bed. Anyone who has spent time in China can appreciate that most beds here are rock hard. Overall the hotel was not standout, particularly with its somewhat hard-to-find location at the back of the World Trade Center, poor access to the street, and ongoing construction outside (but then again, this is China). However, in-room amenities including terrycloth bathrobes and comfy slippers, BBC (so sick of CNN), and - did I mention - the most comfortable beds in China (!), made my stay enjoyable.\n",

It is also walking distance to the Pearl Market/Silk Street shopping area. The rooms are comfortable and a decent size. They could be bigger, but I'm not going to complain about that. Several restaurants on site and you can walk through the China World Mall to the China World Hotel and eat at their restaurants as well. The buffet restaurant on site is OK--fine for breakfast. They have quite a nice selection of eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, cereals, etc.Staff are very friendly and acommodating. They all go out of their way to say good day and greet you when you enter the hotel. Exercise facilities are fine, but not outstanding. Several treadmills, some bikes and a full set of Cybex machines for weight work-outs. There is a full sauna as well. I believe the hotel has a spa/massage service, but I did not take advantage of it.Overall, for the rates, I don't think you can do much better in Beijing.\n",

They have two resturants and one bar in the hotel but there are two other hotels within walking distance that are owned by the same company and allow you to sign meals to your room. The staff was incredibly friendly and were always available. The hotel is located near the SouthEast part of town which makes it convenient to get to the Business Development Area (BDA) and also close to the city center for access to the forbidden city and Tienamen Square.

      "--------------------------\n",
      "44: This hotel is in a great location, right in the middle of business district, above a great shopping mall, with a subway station that allow me to travel all over the city. Taxi is very cheap also. There is a shuttle bus from the airport although it may take some patience to know which airport bus to take and where to get off. The chinese name of the hotel sounds like &quot;Quao-mao&quot; . Saying that to the bus or taxi driver will help you get to the hotel easier. The staff is super friendly, and very attentive. I always feel very welcome in this hotel. The ratio of hotel staff to customer is amzaingly high. If you enjoy being pampered, this is the place to consider. The room size is adequate, and the room are always clean. There are some thoughts to share here though.(1) The gym (free) is located in China World Hotel nearby. You would have to walk to the shopping mall to get to the gym. It can be kind of inconvenient for some. The gym is WOW nice, so it is worth the walk, I think, (2) The hotel may want to consider upgrading to flat-screen TV.(3) The bathroom floor is very slippery when wet. So be very careful, Hotel should really consider replacing them in any upcoming remodel efforts. (4) There is construction nearby at this time, and can be noisy during some days. If you need to sleep during the day time, you may want to book another hotel at this time. Other the minor items above, this is a great hotel. I definitely would stay here in the future because of the great location and super service.\n",

      "--------------------------\n",
      "50: Traders is a comfortable and well-located hotel for business travelers. Beijing hotel prices continue to increase, but Traders remains a good value, especially compared to its sister hotels in the same area (Kerry Centre and China World) which are posh but at a price. Traders' rooms are small but adequate, the hotel staff are pleasant and helpful, and the location in the World Trade Center makes it easy to shop (also within walking distance of the silk market) or take public transportation if you're daring enough. It is also a short ride to the main train station. I stay at Traders most times I pass through Beijing.\n",

      "53: I spent 2 nights at this hotel on my wa to other locations in China. This is a fantastic Hotel, the staff are friendly at room are nice and clean. Just a little advise for new travellers to Beijing - English is not amazingly popular here. On arrival I showed a taxi driver the address of my hotel, but as it was written in english he didnt have a clue. I had to phone the hotel from my mobile and then pass over the phone to the driver so he would know where to go. The rest of the trip wasn't too bad as I met up with an old uni friend who done all the translating for me :-)Other then the language barrier outside the hotel its a great place to stay.\n",

      "59: We went to Beijing to participate in the Skate Beijing 2007 competition. This hotel was chosen because of it's proximity to the rink. Only 2 mins. thru the shopping mall!This is an excellent hotel. I will reccommend it to anyone. It's location is great for business travelers, right in the middle of the Bussines district and just a few steps away from the China World Trade Centre. This is also a family hotel, near shopping malls and accessible transportation. Very helpful staff. They will arrange tours to the Great Wall and other places.The restaurant is EXCELLENT! The best buffet breakfast and dinner I've seen and had the pleasure of feasting on.\n",

      "61: Big hotel big heart\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "62: Basd on tripadvisor reviews I chose this hotel over the seemingly more &quot;grand&quot; New World Hotel. I was working nearby so it came down to a decision between the two. I have to say I was very happy with my choice and here's why...1. I somehow managed to book a room on the &quot;Executive Floor&quot; I think it was because I chose to have breakfast included (an extra 10 pounds from memory). It was SUCH A great move. The floor has its own (quick) check in desk, there is free access to the internet, fax, printer (and even shredder) they have happy hour between 5 or 6-8pm every night which include nibbles and open bar (when I say nibbles, let's just say I didnt need to eat dinner after), b'fast is just down the hall (and it's tasty) and lastly and for me (a regular business traveler) most importantly, there is a large space for you to go and work and /or read (they have a selection of books avaible in English). For me this is ideal, in the words of oneof the Starbucks founders it offers the &quot;thrid place&quot; that we all seek, especially when travelling on business. Sometimes you just need to leave your room but youdont want to have to kit up and head out into the world.enough said...2. the gym is well equipped and is complete with sauna, steam room and spa.3. you have access to the facilities at the nearby New world hotel - i checkied out the facilities, they are amazing- but it is a bit annoying to have to make your way through the underground mall to the hotel and to be honest , i found the modest equippment at the Traders suficient for a workout and relaxation.4. the staff, very friendly and helpful (ok, so their English is not great) but who cares? 5. location.. if you are working near the world trade centre, this hotel is convenient 6. the reviews said the rooms were small but on the exec floor the rooms are much the same as any normal sized 4 star Europeanhotel (believe me I travel A LOT!)7. You get all this for less than a night in a 4 star hotel in Europe EXCEPT you feel like a person NOT a number... So as I said, I checked out the New World and I must say WOW WOW WOW, the lobby is something to behold and to be honest I didnt actually see inside the rooms but as soon as I walked in I had the feeling that another reviwer described, that the hotel was more like a production line than a hotel. It was teeming with people, there were cars coming and going.. sure it felt large and exceptionally grand but it mostly felt cold and unwelcoming.... so I was and remian happy with my choice.Maybe it was because I was lucky enough to land on the executive floor or maybe I have too little experience with hotels in Asia to kow better but this hotel rated highly for me, I would definitely stay there again! Happy travels :-)\n",

      "--------------------------\n",
      "65: Stayed here on a biz trip in early May. Hotel was in a convenient location, part of the China World Complex (shopping centres, offices, China World Hotel).If there are people picking you up or meeting you at the hotel, make sure you tell them that it's Traders (Guo Mao) cos the whole complex in mandarin is called Guo Mao and some people confused the Traders hotel with China World Hotel, its more luxurious sister hotel. The room in Traders in on the small side, but functional and clean. Room service is quite good, with good range of items on the menu.\n",

      "68: Spent 3 nites here as part of a tour package and really liked the property. Was too busy to check out the area, but the small room was equipped with almost EVERYTHING you could think of for a nice stay. Especially liked the restaurant staff. They were relaxed and accomodating and took all the various visitors from all over the world in stride and just seemed to enjoy it all. Would definitely consider another stay in this facilitiy. Accomodating and very comfortable.\n",

      "--------------------------\n",
      "71: For people who are familiar with the Traders Hotel chain, this Beijing property will be familiar. The rooms are Trader-sized ie. perhaps smaller than other hotel chains but adequate for business people who only use the room to sleep in. The hotel staff are all very friendly, pleasant &amp; efficient.The best thing for me was the location. The hotel is part of the World Trade Center complex which meant that I didn't have to venture out into the Beijing smog (if I didn't want to) to get to offices &amp; shops. The underground system, with upmarket brand shops &amp; familiar restaurants &amp; cafes, provides a easy link between the hotel &amp; offices.Another good thing about the hotel is that it is only a 10-minute walk (this time you have to walk outside in the smog) to the 5-storey Silk Market, where you can buy all kinds of things you have set your hearts on.\n",

      "74: the traders is part of the shangri-la chain of well managed hotels (save for the one in shenzhen). it is better known for its convenient location. if you can tolerate a small room, this hotel would be a natural choice. what makes the traders a special hotel is its attentive english speaking front office manager, service manager-concierge, and staff.\n",
