# RNN

20170702 - Set up a basic char-rnn model. It does not however produce meaningful results. Possible improvements:
    -  Use an AWS EC2 engine, connect to Jupyter Notebook, use larger datasets, and train for longer  
    - Try other RNN structures: more layers; LSTM, etc.  
    - Search for other methods to improve RNN performances. Do a more thorough literature review on RNN training.
